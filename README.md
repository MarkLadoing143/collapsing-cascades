A personal web project which details a fictional series about a group of survivors trying to get through the aftermath of a massive earthquake in Vancouver, Canada.

## Summary
February 22, 2018: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Oliver Leung is spending his day off downtown on what seems like another clear mild day. But the serenity is soon shattered, as a magnitude 8.3 megathrust earthquake occurs, destroying most of Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest. Joined by fellow survivor Tim Huang, the two must wade through the destruction and chaos, in an effort to locate their missing friends and family.
