A Personal Web Development Project which details a fictional story about a group of survivors trying to get through the aftermath of a massive earthquake in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

## Description
Originally created in early 2014 using only XHTML and CSS as one of my first web development assignments for COMP 1511 â€“ Web I: Client Development at Mount Royal University. This latest version now uses HTML5, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to provide responsive web design and elements, as well as contains improved contents and images to reflect updates made to the story.

## Story Summary
February 22, 2018: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Oliver Leung is spending his day off downtown on what seems like another clear mild day. But the serenity is soon shattered as a magnitude 8.3 megathrust earthquake occurs, destroying many towns and cities across the Pacific Northwest. Joined by fellow survivor Tim Huang, the two must wade through the destruction and chaos, in an effort to locate their missing friends and family.
