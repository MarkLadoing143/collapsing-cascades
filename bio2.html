					Originally from Taiwan, Tim is an upbeat, bubbly guy who always seems optimistic with few things to worry about in life.
					Studying Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, Tim lives in the city of Richmond with his mother, a
					full-time nurse working at a local hospital, while his father serves overseas with the Canadian Royal Forces.<br><br>
					
					Tim was born in a large provincial-level city in Taiwan, where his father originally worked as a firefighter, while his mother studied at university.
					However, after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Jiji_earthquake">devastating earthquake on September 21, 1999</a>, the family felt it would be best if they moved to somewhere more peaceful
					and safe, eventually landing in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2001. Unable to find work, Tim's father initially inlisted as a reservist, before entering
					full-time as a Non-Commission Officer due to his previous experience as conscript in the Republic of China Army.<br><br>
					Because of his father's work, Tim spent most of his early life as a military brat, jump from city to city with little time to make any real friends.
					At the age of 14, Tim's family eventually ended up in Vancouver, where it was decided that he and his mother would permanently settle while his father
					would continue his duty. Despite this separation, and the culture shock and loneliness he felt upon settling for the first time, Tim did eventually adapt
					and eventually grew to be very comfortable in Vancouver. Being from Chiayi, he is a big baseball fan who originally followed teams in Taiwan and Japan as kid, and
					now getting involved in hockey and going to Canucks games during the weekend. Having been forced to rapidly adapt to Canada at a young age, Tim doesn't know much
					about Taiwanese or Chinese culture nor its languages, but has begun to recently show interest in learning. He is strong-headed, and always trying to find the better
					things in life, even if it seems like the world has none...
