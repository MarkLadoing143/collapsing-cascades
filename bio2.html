					Originally from Taiwan, Tim is an upbeat, bubbly guy who always seems optimistic with few things to worry about in life.
					Studying Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, Tim lives in the city of Richmond with his mother, a
					full-time nurse working at a local hospital, while his father serves overseas with the Canadian Royal Forces.<br><br>
					
					Tim was born in a large provincial-level city of Chiayi in Taiwan, where his father (a third-generation Chinese Canadian from Victoria, B.C.)
					met his native Taiwanese mother while studying abroad at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan City. Tim lived in Taiwan for only a brief period, 
					when a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Jiji_earthquake">devastating earthquake struck the region on September 21, 1999</a>. After that,
					the family felt it would be best if they moved to somewhere safer, eventually landing in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada in 2001. 
					During this time, Tim's father decided to switch paths and enlisted in the Royal Canadian Armed Forces, following in the footsteps of his parents
					who had also been in the Canadian military.<br><br>
					
					Because of his father's work, Tim spent most of his early life as a military brat, jumping from city to city with little time to make any real friends.
					Despite leaving Taiwan at a young age, Tim has frequently gone back to visit, gaining exposure to Taiwanese culture and life during those periods.
					At the age of 14, Tim's family eventually ended up in Metro Vancouver, where it was decided that he and his mother would permanently settle while his father
					would continue his duty.<br><br>
					
					Because of his Taiwanese roots, Tim is big baseball fan, following teams in Taiwan and Canada since he was a kid. But while he has had ample oppertunity to see Taiwan, 
					Tim doesn't feel as deeply connected to Taiwanese or Chinese culture nor its languages due to his upbringing as a Chinese Canadian, but has begun to recently show interest in learning. 
					Even though he didn't have many friends and at times feels lonely, Tim is strong-headed and always trying to find the better things in life, even if it seems like the world has none...
