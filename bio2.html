				<p>
					Originally from Winnipeg, Tim is an upbeat, bubbly guy who always seems optimistic with few things to worry about in life.
					A junior in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, Tim lives in Port Moody with his mother (a full-time Nurse),
					while his father serves overseas with the Canadian Royal Forces.<br><br>
					
					Because of his father's work, Tim spent most of his early life as a military brat, jump from city to city with little time to make any real friends.
					At the age of 14, Tim's family eventually ended up in Vancouver, where it was decided that he and his mother would permanently settle while his father
					would continue his duty. Despite this separation, and the culture shock and loneliness he felt upon settling for the first time, Tim did eventually adapt
					and eventually grew to be very comfortable in Vancouver. Even though he spent little time there, Tim has a soft spot for his home-city of Winnipeg, openly
					supporting the Winnipeg Jets despite rivalry with the locals.
