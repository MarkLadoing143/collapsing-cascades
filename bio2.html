					Originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Tim is an upbeat, bubbly guy who always seems optimistic and with few things to worry about in life.
					Tim really just embraces life and all of what it has to offer by being a weird, happy dork who really loves video games, anime, and travel.<br><br>
					
					Now a junior in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, Tim has been living in Vancouver with his mother who works full-time as a nurse,
					while his father serves overseas with the Canadian Royal Forces.<br><br>
					
					But while Tim doesn't really have any issues to deal with, that in itself is the problem. Tim often fails to take things seriously, ignorant of
					his future and often too chipper to see the problems in the world, nor those actually taking place in his own life. Tim seemingly tries to bury his
					problems, including a potential scenario of his parents divorcing, by ignoring them and acting positively in hopes of things working out themselves.<br><br>
					
					But as the Pacifc Northwest Disater unfolds, Tim is going to have face facts and quickly learn that not all in the world is fair and right, 
					and that he must be prepared for that because as the earthquake proves, optimism can only get you so far before reality hits back...
