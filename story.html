					<h3>VANCOUVER. FEBRUARY 11, 2018. 1:43PM.</h3>
					<p>
						On February 11, 2018, a massive Magnitude 8.0 earthquake hit the Pacific Northwest region of North America,
						impacting several major cities including Seattle and Portland in the United States, and Vancouver and Victoria in Canada.<br><br>
						
						Dubbed "The Pacific Northwest Disaster", the quake was the result of a slip between two plates off the North American coast
						in an area known as the "Cascadia subduction zone". Beginning in Northern California, the slip resulted in a disastrous
						chain reaction that quickly moved northward toward Vancouver, releasing in its wake a massive earthquake that lasted over 7 minutes,
						and triggering a 40-meter high Tsunami that engulfed dozens of coastal towns from northern California, all the way to the southern
						tip of Vancouver Island.<br><br>
						
						The disaster became the worst in North American history and the second deadliest earthquake in recorded history, killing more than
						700,000 people in both the United States and Canada, surpassing both the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake
						as the deadliest disaster of the 21st Century. Some estimates go even further, claiming that up to 2 million dead or missing 
						as a result of the earthquake and tsunami.<br><br>
						
						In several reports released after the disaster, investigators contributed the high death toll to the collapse of buildings, roads, and
						bridges, which had not been properly reinforced for such a large earthquake. Investigators also blamed several organizations for failing
						to properly conduct evaluation procedures in coastal areas during the tsunami, leaving many towns unprepared and, in some cases, unaware of
						the impending disaster. Failures to also properly coordinate rescue and emergency efforts were also noted, as hospitals and fire departments
						were quickly overwhelmed by the number of injured and dead in the aftermath.<br><br>
						
						An additional, but not supported, factor that also contributed to deaths was the failure of armed forces and police to control chaos in the major cities, 
						as reports of rioting, looting, and even violence occurring during the disaster quickly came out in the aftermath.<br><br><br>
						
						
						<b>Collapsing Cascades</b> tells the story of two young men, Oliver Lockwood and Tim Henderson, 
						as they attempt to traverse a crumbling Vancouver in the horrid aftermath.<br><br> 
						
						With bodies piling every corner, deranged rioters ready to kill, and endless aftershocks that threaten to knock out the every building in the region, 
						the two will have to literally fight to survive as they walk from Vancouver to an makeshift emergency centre in Burnaby, in the desperate
						struggle to contact each other's family,<br><br> 
						
						<b>for better or worse...</b>
