					<i>Information provided by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone">Wikipedia</a></i><br><br>
					
					The Cascadia Subduction Zone, also known as the Cascadia Fault, is the Subduction Zone between the Juan de Fuca and
					North America tectonic plates located of the Northern American coast between northern California and southern British Columbia.<br><br>
					
					A Subduction Zone is the area in which two tectonic plates meet up. But instead of simply lining up with one another, one plate ends up
					being forced under the other, forcibly sliding into each other like a siding door. The resulting friction then causes the plate on top to be dragged, 
					forcing rock and dirt to move in the direction of the plate under it, thus compressing the earth.<br><br>
					
					The danger with this is that with more time that passes, the more earth that gets compressed, creating additional stresses on the plates.
					If not released, the upper plate will eventually "spring loose" and release all the built up earth and rock in a single motion. 
					It is this motion, and the energy it releases, that causes incredibly powerful and deadly earthquakes, known as megathrust earthquakes.<br><br>
					
					Megathrust earthquakes have been at the epicenter of some of the worst disasters of the 21st century such as the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami and the
					2011 Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami.<br><br>
					
					The last major earthquake to occur within the Cascadia Subduction Zone happened around 1700, and with studies showing the frequency of megathrust
					events as being around every 300 to 600 years, the risk for another megathrust earthquake in the Pacific Northwest is high. A release in Cascadia would
					follow the entire length of the zone, resulting in an earthquake that could surpass Magnitude 8.0, last up to or more than 7 minutes, and
					result in a Tsunami that could reach heights of up to 30 meters.<br><br>
					
					The earthquake would impact all the major cities within the Pacific Northwest including Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver and with how little preparation
					each of these cites have against large earthquakes, could result in immense deaths and injuries...
