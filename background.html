				<h3>What is Collapsing Cascades?</h3>
				<p>
					Collapsing Cascades is a conceptual story series based on a 'what-if' scenario about what were to happen if a major earthquake were to hit
					North America.<br><br>
					
					While the story itself is complete fictitious, the setting in which it takes places and the events that surround it are
					in fact based on reality. The Cascadia subduction zone did in the past actually cause a Magnitude 8.0 earthquake
					some 300 years ago. Following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, many experts have speculated that the zone is overdue for another megathrust earthquake,
					which may occur sometime in the near future as predicted in this story.
