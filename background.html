				<h3>What is Collapsing Cascades?</h3>
				<p>
					Collapsing Cascades is a fictional series about what were to happen if a major earthquake were to hit
					North America. While the story itself is complete fictitious, the setting in which it takes places and the events that surround it are
					in fact based on reality.
				</p>
				<h3>Development History</h3>
				<p>
					Development began shortly after the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, which coincidently was also
					my 16th Birthday. I was distraught and wishing to memorialise the event, I began writing Collapsing Cascades as a tale of survival, comradery,
					community, and bravery as the citizens of North America work together to make it through adversity. Ironically, such a story of teamwork and perseverance 
					has now become somewhat of a relevant talking point nowadays, as with such a time of divisiveness, unhappiness,
					and hatred, Collapsing Cascades tries to reflect the bad and good of tragedy and how the human spirit can fight on in such darkness.<br><br>
					
					I also wrote Collapsing Cascades to be the antithesis of what I saw in many American disaster films and media. More often or not, disaster films
					focus more on the destruction and chaos, with characters becoming nothing more than objects to run from this destruction. This generally
					creates narratives that are overly melodramatic with flat characters that gain little development or growth over the course of the film. My goal with
					Collapsing Cascades was to create a human-centric piece where the aftermath of the disaster is depicted, with people struggling to gather themselves
					up and work together, while the world around them literally crumbled.<br><br>
					
					In 2016, Collapsing Cascades received some major updates in its setting and characters, as I felt that the premise no longer fit what I was trying to
					write. In its original form, the story was set in Seattle, Washington, with two main characters being of Northern European decent. Oliver was named
					Oliver Knutson Lindberg and was Swedish American, Tim was named Timothy Koski Heikinen and was Finnish Canadian, and both had blue eyes and blond hair.
					I was unhappy with this approach as their characterizations felt unrealistic, and thus completely overhaul the story.<br><br>
					
					I ended up moving the story to Vancouver, Canada as I was more familiar with the city, and changed their nationalities to better reflect the ethnic demographics of
					the city, which happens to be predominantly Asian Canadian. I also wanted to portray a demographic which I felt was under-represented in Canadian media
					and show off the multicultural side of Canada, and how we as a country can work together to get through anything, even tragedy.<br><br>

				<h3>The Science of Collapsing Cascades</h3>
				<p>
					Surrounding the coast of the Pacific Northwest is the Cascadia Subduction Zone, an area where the Juan de Fuca 
					tectonic plate converges with the North American Plate. Currently, the Juan de Fuca pushes underneath the North American,
					causing much of the volcanic activity that occurs the area. But should the Juan de Fuca Plate become "stuck"
					under the North American Plate, the pressure and force would built up that coud lead to a sudden rupture, triggering a megathrust earthquake similar
					to that which occurred with the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Experts have determined that a megathrust
					earthquake did occur some 300 years ago, causing a tsunami that proportedly reached Eastern Japan, and that their is a 37% chance of a magnitude
					8.0 or higher earthquake occuring within the next 50 years.
				</p>
				<h3>Inspirations</h3>
				<p>
					 Collapsing Cascades' tone and story were inspired by two pieces of media.<br><br>
					 
					 The first was a Japanese Anime series called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Magnitude_8.0"><b>Tokyo Magnitude 8.0</b></a>. Aired in 2009, the 11-episode series tells the story of two Japanese children, Mirai
					 and Yuki Onozawa, and their attempt to get home after a magnitude 8.0 hits the center of Tokyo. Unlike most disaster stories, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is
					 very downturn and at times somber, with the kids often struggling with feelings of hopelessness and post-traumatic stress due to the destruction and the thought of their
					 families being "gone". It was a series which I felt really reflected what I wanted Collapsing Cascades to be like.<br><br>
					 
					 The other is a English-Language Spanish film called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_(2012_film)"><b>The Impossible</b></a>. Released in 2012, the film is based on the true story of a Spanish family that survived
					 the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami during a vacation in Thailand. Much like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, the film mostly centers on the family's attempt to survive, as
					 they are seperated by the tsunami and must find one another, despite evidence to say the other is long gone and probably dead. Unlike many other types of disaster films,
					 which rely heavily on digital effects and often sacrifice character development, The Impossible was special in that it mainly used real water and sets filmed in Southeast Asia
					 to provide a more authentic feel and was a more character-driven piece about this family's struggle.
