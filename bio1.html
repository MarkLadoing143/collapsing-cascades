					Originally from Hong Kong, Oliver is a Mechanical Engineer working in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Generally more introverted
					and indifferent to most situations, Oliver is a quiet individual who feels more comfortable on his own then with others, in turn causing him to be more distant
					and awkward in social situations. But despite his cold exterior, Oliver truly cares for those around him and while he may not always show his emotions, deep down he is
					warm-hearted and humble.<br><br>
					
					Born in a former industrial area near the now-closed Kai Tak International Airport, his father (a Royal Hong Kong Police Officer) and his mother (an Secondary School Teacher)
					decided to leave Hong Kong in 1995 before the impending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_sovereignty_over_Hong_Kong">1997 Handover to China</a>, 
					eventually immigrating to Canada and settling in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This did not last long, as Oliver's mother was killed in a tragic accident in 2001,
					forcing the family to once again move to Vancouver and causing friction between Oliver and his now widowed father.<br><br>
					
					Despite leaving Hong Kong at such a young age, Oliver retained his Hong Konger roots, and is bilingual in both Cantonese and English. Oliver is also a fan of English Football, following teams both in Hong Kong and Canada. 
					Nowadays, Oliver still remains distant with his remaining family, as his father now spends most of his time working overseas in Asia,
					leaving Oliver to work in Canada alone with few people in his life that he can call friends...
