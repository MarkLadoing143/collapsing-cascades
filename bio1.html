					Originally from Hong Kong, Oliver is a man who recently graduated at Simon Fraser University, and now works as a Junior Mechanical Engineer in Downtown Vancouver. Generally laid-back
					and indifferent to most situations, Oliver is a mostly quiet individual who feels more comfortable on his own then with others, in turn causing him to be more distant
					and awkward in social situations. But despite his cold exterior, Oliver truly cares for those around him and while he may not always show his emotions, deep down he is
					warm-hearted and humble.<br><br>
					
					Born in a former industrial area near the now-closed Kai Tak International Airport, his father (a Royal Hong Kong Police Officer) and his mother (an Secondary School Teacher)
					decided to leave Hong Kong in 1995 fearing the impending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_sovereignty_over_Hong_Kong">1997 Handover to China</a>, 
					eventually immigrating to Canada and settling in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 
					Despite leaving Hong Kong at the age of three, Oliver is bilingual in both Cantonese and English, and has frequently associated with Chinese Canadian Organizations
					due to his parents' encouragement. In line with his roots, Oliver is a fan of English Football, following teams both in Hong Kong and Canada. 
					However nowadays, Oliver has not been in close touch with his family since he moved to Vancouver, having fallen out with them several years earlier over differences
					in where Oliver wanted to take his career. Now, Oliver lives with alone, living a solemn life going to work every day with little drama...
