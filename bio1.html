				<p>
					Originally from Hong Kong, Oliver is a solemn man who recently graduated at Simon Fraser University, and now works as an engineer in Downtown Vancover. Generally laid-back
					and indifferent to most situations, Oliver is a mostly quiet individual who feels more comfortable on his own then with others, in turn causing him to be more distant
					and awkward in social situations. But despite his cold exterior, Oliver truly cares for those around him and while he may not always show his emotions, deep down he is
					warm-hearted and humble.<br><br>
					
					Born in a former industrial area near the now-closed Kai Tak International Airport, his father (a Royal Hong Kong Police Officer) and his mother (an Secondary School Teacher)
					decided to leave Hong Kong in 1995 fearing the impending Handover to China, eventually immigrating to Canada and settling in the city of Victoria, British Columbia. Now living
					Coquitlam on the mainland, he now routinely commutes to Vancouver for work, and has a strong personal friendship with fellow co-worker Joel Dacquel.
