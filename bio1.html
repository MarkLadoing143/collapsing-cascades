<!-- 					At first glance, there really isn't much to Oliver. A Victoria-native, Oliver is a solemn man who spent his youth as a med student at Simon Fraser University, 
					only to then give up on that career path when the economy fell and has now spent the early part of his thirties working as a security guard in downtown Vancouver.
					But under the surface, Oliver's journey to where he is today has been a rough ride...<br><br>
					
					Born to am engineer from Nanaimo, British Columbia and an ESL teacher from Leeds, England, Oliver spent a significant portion of his adolencence living as
					an expatriate in Asia, starting in British Hong Kong before moving onto Japan in 1997 following the Handover to China. As a result, Oliver gained many experiences
					that few Canadian children would ever get, getting to travel to many destinations and learning several languages with Cantonese and Japanese being his strongest.<br><br>
					
					But this all changed in 2004 during what was suppose to be a Christmas vacation in Thailand turned to horror, when his mother was washed away in the Indian Ocean Tsunami, only to never
					be found and later assumed dead...<br><br>
					
					From this point forward, things quickly fell apart, as his surviving family began to slip further apart and into the grips of depression. They moved back to Britsh Columbia not soon after,
					with Oliver's father deciding to keep moving around as an expat, while Oliver went on to live the rest of his life in Vancouver.<br><br>
					
					The disaster and subsequent aftermath quickly broke Oliver's emotional state; he quickly became introverted and unable to empathize with others, regressing his ability to connect with others
					beyond a personal level, and thus leaving him very quiet, outspoken, and isolated from any true friendships.<br><br>
					
					Now miles from home and unable to contact his father by the earthquake, Oliver now has to overcome his emotional truamas and find the strength to move forward and find a way to get home and contact his
					father, no matter how dangerous it may be... -->
					
					Originally from Hong Kong, Oliver is a solemn man who recently graduated at Simon Fraser University, and now works as an engineer in Downtown Vancover. Generally laid-back
					and indifferent to most situations, Oliver is a mostly quiet individual who feels more comfortable on his own then with others, in turn causing him to be more distant
					and awkward in social situations. But despite his cold exterior, Oliver truly cares for those around him and while he may not always show his emotions, deep down he is
					warm-hearted and humble.<br><br>
					
					Born in a former industrial area near the now-closed Kai Tak International Airport, his father (a Royal Hong Kong Police Officer) and his mother (an Secondary School Teacher)
					decided to leave Hong Kong in 1995 fearing the impending Handover to China, eventually immigrating to Canada and settling in the city of Victoria, British Columbia.
					Despite not leaving Hong Kong at the age of three, Oliver is bilingual in both Cantonese and English, and has frequently associated with Chinese Canadian Organizations
					due to his parents' encouragement. In line with his roots, Oliver is a fan of English Football, following teams both in Hong Kong and Canada. Now living
					Port Coquitlam on the mainland, he now routinely commutes to Vancouver for work, and has a strong personal friendship with fellow co-worker Joel Dacquel.
